NiMH battery curve - http://www.stefanv.com/electronics/using_nimh/nimh_vs_alkaline.gif
Max voltage: 1.25v per cell, so 7.5.  We are seeing topped off of 1.28 or 7.7v
Min voltage: 1v per cell, so 6v in our case
    
Charging: https://www.powerstream.com/NiMH.htm
        Trickle Charging - C/30 to C/20 - so 0.09A
        Safe/cheapest - Charge at C/10 - No end-of-charge sensor.  Not past 13hrs.
            1800 mAh is 0.18A
                Note the wall changer charges at 0.2
        Faster - C/3.3 for 5 hours if fully depleated. Must sense dV or dT.  0.54A
        If temp sensor, can do C/1 for 1.5 hours. 1.8A
        
        Specific charger charges at 1.2A, but likely senses the cuttoff. C/1.5
        
        Memory can be an issue.  Best to fully take it down, then charge.
